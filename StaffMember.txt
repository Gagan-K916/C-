You are tasked with designing a system for a school to manage different types of staff 

members: teachers and administrative staff. Both types of staff members share some 

common attributes such as name, age, and salary, but they also have their own unique 

attributes and behaviors(Methods).

Design a C# program using inheritance to model this system. Implement a base class called 

StaffMember that includes common attributes and behaviors for both teachers and 

administrative staff. Then, create derived classes Teacher and AdministrativeStaff that 

inherit from StaffMember and add specific attributes and behaviors for each role.

Your program should allow for the following functionality:

 Create instances of teachers and administrative staff with different attributes.

 Display the details of each staff member, including their specific attributes.

public class StaffMember
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
    public StaffMember(string name, int age, decimal salary)
    {
        Name = name;
        Age = age;
        Salary = salary;
    }
    public virtual void DisplayDetails()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Name: {Name}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Age: {Age}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Salary: ${Salary:F2}");
    }
}
public class Teacher : StaffMember
{
    public string Subject { get; set; }
    public Teacher(string name, int age, decimal salary, string subject) : base(name, age, salary)
    {
        Subject = subject;
    }
    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        base.DisplayDetails();
        Console.WriteLine($"Subject: {Subject}");
    }
}
public class AdministrativeStaff : StaffMember
{
    public string Department { get; set; }
    public AdministrativeStaff(string name, int age, decimal salary, string department) : base(name, age, salary)
    {
        Department = department;
    }
    public override void DisplayDetails()
    {
        base.DisplayDetails();
        Console.WriteLine($"Department: {Department}");
    }
}
public class StaffManagementSystem
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        List<StaffMember> staffList = new List<StaffMember>();
        // Create teacher instances
        staffList.Add(new Teacher("John Doe", 40, 50000, "Math"));
        staffList.Add(new Teacher("Jane Smith", 35, 45000, "English"));
        // Create administrative staff instances
        staffList.Add(new AdministrativeStaff("Mike Brown", 42, 35000, "Finance"));
        staffList.Add(new AdministrativeStaff("Alice Lee", 38, 38000, "Admissions"));
        // Display staff details
        Console.WriteLine("**Staff Details**");
        foreach (StaffMember staff in staffList)
        {
            staff.DisplayDetails();
            Console.WriteLine();
        }
        // Calculate total salary expenditure
        Decimal totalSalary = staffList.Sum(staff => staff.Salary);
        Console.WriteLine($"Total Salary Expenditure: ${totalSalary:F2}");
    }
}
